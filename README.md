# FIN-525 Final Project

This project conducts various filtering methods on the cross-correlation matrix of cryptocurrency returns, aiming to construct an optimal investment portfolio in the dynamic landscape of digital assets. Building on Markowitz's work, we focus on the estimation of correlation matrices. Recognizing the limitations of empirical cross-correlation matrices in real financial markets, we explore various filtering techniques using Random Matrix Theory, Thresholding, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Planar Maximally Filtered Graph. Additionally, correlation-based clustering procedures are incorporated to identify asset groups with correlated movements, enabling a well-balanced risk exposure. Finally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed on each cluster to identify \textit{leading coins} that can be used to create a global minimum variance portfolio. Using hourly log-returns of 269 cryptocurrencies from the period 01/01/2021 to 31/12/2022, we assess the stability of identified clusters and conduct a comparative analysis of out-of-sample risks associated with the different filtering methods.
